How memory is managed in Python ?

    ==> Memory management in Python involves the management of a private heap.
        A private heap is a portion of memory that is exclusive to the Python process.
        All Python objects and data structures are stored in the private heap.
        The operating system cannot allocate this piece of memory to another process.
