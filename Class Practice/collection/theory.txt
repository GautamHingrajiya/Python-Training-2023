There are 4 types of collection 
    1)list
    2)tuple
    3)set
    4)dictionary

1)  list : list is collection data type which is contain similar or dis-similar data elements
        -> list is indicate or represent by [ ]
        -> list is contain unique and duplicate values.
        -> list is mutable, orderable, indexable.
        -> by deafult list index always start from 0.
        -> there are 2 ways to creat list using of [ ] and list constuctor

        E.g 
        l1 = [ ] # 1st way to create list
        l2 = list()  #2nd way to create list


    # add some values in list 
    # list index always start from 0 index

    there are 3 ways to add data in existing list

        1) append() : to store data in existing list
        2) extend() : to add more then 1 value in list
        3) insert() : to store element in list at specific position

        # 1) append() : to store data in existing list

            for i in range(1,4):
                name = input("Enter Your Subject :")
                l1.append(name)
            print(l1)   

        # 2) extend() : to add more then 1 value in list


            l1.extend(["react","node","javascript"])
            print(l1)


        # 3) insert() : to store element in list at specific position
        
            l1.insert(1,"python programing")
            print(l1)
        
    there are 3 ways to remove element from the list

        1) remove() : using remove element from list value wise
        2) pop() : using pop we can remove last element of the list and we can pop(index) specific index value
        3) clear() : using clear we can remve all the elements from list
        4) del : del is keyword using of del keyword we can delete list from memory


2)  tuple :

    # diff between list and tuple
 
    ==> list and tuple is a collection data type which is contain similar and dis-similar data elements.
        list is represent by [] breces or tuple is represent by () breces
 
    ==>list which is mutable when tuple is a immutable 

    ==>list is slower then tuple 

3) set : set is a collection data type

    # set which is immutable,unorderable,unindexable
    # set does not contain duplicate element
    # set which is represent by {} breces

4) dictionary : which is collection data type 
                which is repesent by {} breces
                dictionary which is contain key and value in a pair

            E.g

            student={
            key : value,
            key : value,
            key : value,
             .
             .
             .
             .
             .
            }
